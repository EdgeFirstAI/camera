# EdgeFirst Camera

The EdgeFirst Camera service implements the standard ROS2 camera interfaces plus a proprietary extension to provide DMA support.  As with all EdgeFirst services the ROS2 interfaces are implemented over Zenoh and can plug into a true ROS2 setup using the zenoh-bridge-dds service.
